# TODO
 - resolve TODOs left into the code
 - rate limiters:
  - instances
  - flag submit
  - registration
  - attachments download
  - check mail server provider rate limits
 - tests:
   - integration tests (for generic behaviour)
   - tests for distributed functioning (already live testing & hand tested)
 - utility:
   - better names for binary flags
   - DOCUMENTATION

## Frontend
 - [/] Extra:
   - [ ] Add custom button themes for first/second/third bloods? (Analysis done)

## Ideas / Features
 - rename "hash domain" (not an hash anymore, only rand bytes)
 - make retries on registration with email
 - editable homepage & theme
 - submissions page filers (first bloods, only wrong, group filter [correct, repeated])
 - extract data for ctftime
 - N instance limit per team
 - scoreboard freeze (idea: use a table or a view to take a snapshot of the scoreboard, update it every time someone solves if not in freeze time (or just prefetch and compute if not exists))
 - telegram bot for first bloods (and webhook generalization) + pipeline tests
 - login via CTFTime
 - default starting points for challenges as global config
 - kube support
 - swarm support
 - ctf stats page
 - flag submit that checks for all challenges and mark solved the one of the correct flag (credits to: midnightsun)
 - writeups for challs into the platform (visible after ctf ends)
 - signed flags (AES ECB or hmac with team id (4 byte) and chall id (4 byte))
 - hook system for team based attachments (a different/unique attachment for each team)
 - likes and dislikes for challs (only for who actually solved)
 - kick user from team
 - endpoint to store image files (like badges and pfp)
 - flag format validator
 - ingress only challenges (verify if useful)
 - chall time schedule release
 - login via /verify with a valid token
 - chall sequence (unlock a challenge by solving another chall)
